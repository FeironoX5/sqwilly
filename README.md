# Sqwilly

a tool to visualize relationship between two selected sql tables, because sometimes it's so hard to find exact fields that connect two tables (as it may be a pretty long path through multiple tables).

features to add:
- route highlighting
- generate joins sql request
- some imports & outputs
- does draw.io have auto drawing, when pasting just raw data??
- import from image (mb)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
